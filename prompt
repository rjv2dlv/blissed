I want to create a flutter app that i can deploy on apple store and play store.

I am into a coaching where some of the things we do everyday is:
A) Set 2 daily actions (Space for adding more actions)

B) Ask yourself the below questions and set a reminder (maybe every 2/3 hours to remind you):
1. Who do you want to be today ?
Focused worker, calm angel, creative tiger, electric dreamer, driven dragon, or anything else. define in 2 words

2. How am I going to connect with people today?
With friendliness, understanding, positivity, compassion, engaging manner, with empathy, or so on.

3. What can I do today to make the day amazing?
Complete my pending tasks, some activity at work, something I've never done before, or so on.

4. 2 simple changes on how you show up?
With high energy and involvement, patience and discipline, love and compassion, etc.


C) Suggest a random act of kindness for the day.

D) History/Progress for Check-ins and acts of kindness done, plus other things.
